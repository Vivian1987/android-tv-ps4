# Release notes

## 1.1

More consoles and a single download. Thanks to everyone who commented and opened issues on 1.0; most of this release came from those reports.

`Android-TV-for-PS4-1.1.pkg`, 3,123,380,224 bytes, SHA256 `f3a4497e5ef2a4814933ede0f05e18f18b847714314bdb83f4b71c7f3fab975e`

**Updated again 26 Oct:** Slims, Pros and fat CUH-12xx consoles (the Belize southbridge) stopped with "SETUP FAILED (status 255)" because they couldn't open the PS4's user partition. From the CUH-1200 on, the drive encryption also mixes in the partition number, and 1.1 now tries the right layout for each console. It hasn't been confirmed on a Slim or Pro yet, so reports are welcome. Thanks to everyone who sent logs; ten reports pointed at this one line. Also fixed: on 6.72, sending the Linux payload could give up with error 35 when BinLoader paused. The PKG is now on MediaFire. The previous build was SHA256 `1446d780…048dd`.

**Updated 26 Oct:** fixes "There wasn't enough free memory to start Linux" (code 12), including on consoles where restarting didn't help. The loader used to need two unbroken blocks of memory of about 12 MB and 10 MB; it now copies Linux in pieces of 2 MB or less and puts them together at handover. `launcher-boot.log` records how many pieces it took and whether the old method would have worked. To update, delete Android TV for PS4 from the home screen (your Android data is kept), then install the new PKG. The first 1.1 build was 3,123,052,544 bytes, SHA256 `57cfbaff…30ff5`.

> **How the fix works, in car park terms.** To start Linux, the PS4 has to hold the kernel (12 MB) and the startup files (10 MB) in memory while it shuts down. The old loader asked for 12 empty bays in a row. After a big install the PS4's memory is like a car park at the end of a busy day: plenty of free bays, but scattered, so a row of 12 often wasn't there. That was code 12, and it's why restarting (emptying the car park) usually helped. The new loader parks each 2 MB piece wherever there's a free bay and writes down where it went. At handover the PS4 has shut down and the whole car park is empty, so a few lines of code move every piece into place, end to end, and Linux starts as before. Pieces are never parked where the final copy goes, every byte is checksummed, and if anything doesn't add up it stops on the PS4 with a message instead of a black screen.

### What's new

- **Every firmware the Linux loader supports.** The package now contains a kexec build for each firmware [ps4-linux-loader](https://github.com/ps4-linux/ps4-linux-loader) has kernel offsets for (5.05 to 13.52, [full list](COMPATIBILITY.md#firmware)), and picks the right one at launch. 1.0 only ran on 13.52.
- **No console model is blocked.** 1.0 stopped on anything but the Aeolia southbridge, both in the launcher and in the Linux start script. 1.1 records the southbridge in the log and carries on. Slim, Pro and Belize/Baikal fat models are untested; reports are very welcome.
- **Boots without Ethernet hardware.** A console with no Ethernet interface used to stop the Linux start; now it continues without it.
- **Single-file download.** No more joining parts.
- **Clearer errors.** Unsupported firmware, low memory (error 12) and boot-file problems now say what happened and what to do. If the previous Linux start didn't finish, the launcher shows the last step it reached.
- **More reliable video.** Some video could freeze after a few seconds while the sound kept playing, for example in YouTube and the NBA app. The graphics allocator now lays out video frames the way the PS4's GPU driver needs, so playback keeps going. The same fix also makes Spotify's music videos play.
- **The controller works like a TV remote in every app.** X selects and Circle goes back everywhere. In 1.0, a few apps only listened to a TV remote on some screens, so the controller did nothing there, for example Kayo's sign-in button and going back in the NBA app.
- **Screensaver instead of sleep.** When idle, Android now shows a screensaver and keeps running. Android's sleep mode froze PS4 Linux, so the console needed a hard restart. A small stick dead zone also stops a resting DualShock 4 from keeping the screen awake.
- **Device name defaults to "PlayStation 4"**, so Spotify Connect and casting list the console by name.
- **Slim, Pro and Baikal hardware support.** Wi-Fi and Bluetooth firmware for the Marvell 88W8897 and MediaTek MT7668, a separate kernel for Baikal consoles with their Ethernet driver, and a graphics fix for the Pro's GPU. Reports from Belize Slims and Pros show Linux, the GPU (including the Pro's), Marvell Wi-Fi and Bluetooth coming up; nobody on a Slim, Pro or Baikal console has reached Android yet. See [Hardware support](HARDWARE.md).
- **Failed starts explain themselves.** If Linux can't start Android, it says why, makes it safe to power off, and copies its reports to a USB stick as soon as one is plugged in. Every start also saves a hardware report (`hardware.txt`) listing the console's chips and the drivers that loaded.
- **App storage folders work.** Android tags each app's shared-storage folder with an ext4 project ID, which the 1.0 kernel couldn't do, so apps were refused the folder. That made some apps crash and Google setup restart itself two or three times; setup can still jump back once, from a cause not yet found. The kernel now has quota support, new installs format Android storage with it, and existing installs get it added once at startup, checked before and after. It only happens if the running kernel can mount the result.
- **No background crash loop.** A permission in this Android build mapped to a group the system doesn't know, so the Shell app failed to start and was retried every 10 seconds. That mapping is removed at boot.
- **Faster launches.** The launcher used to re-read about 1.5 GB of installed files on every launch to check them, which could take up to two minutes after a restart and fragmented memory just before Linux needed it. Each file is now checked once and remembered until it or the package changes.
- **Clearer error screen.** When startup stops, the launcher stops its activity bar and leads with what to do, for example "Restart your PS4, then open Android TV again" when memory is short.
- **Internal drive found reliably.** Linux now finds the PS4's drive by its Android partition, so consoles whose internal drive sits behind a USB bridge aren't skipped.
- **Updating no longer fails with errno 17** when an older backup of the boot files is present.
- **Own boot folder.** Boot files now live in `/user/app/ps4-android/boot` instead of `/data/linux/boot`, so 1.1 can't collide with another PS4 Linux setup. That is the likely cause of the errno 13 install error reported on 1.0.

### Tested

Fresh install over FTP and first boot to Android TV with this exact package on a CUH-1102A on 13.52, plus video, controller, screensaver, Spotify Connect and the bundled apps. Everything else is waiting on [test reports](COMPATIBILITY.md#reporting-a-result).

### Updating

Delete Android TV for PS4 from the PS4 home screen, then install the 1.1 PKG. Your Android apps and data are stored separately and are kept ([details](INSTALL.md#updating-from-10)). If you had renamed the device, it's set to PlayStation 4 once; rename it again in Settings.

On the first start, Linux adds project quota support to Android's storage once. After that, the 1.0 kernel can't open it, so going back to 1.0 isn't supported.

In the first 1.1 build, the first launch after installing or updating often stopped with "Restart your PS4, then open Android TV again" (code 12). The 26 Oct update fixes that ([details](INSTALL.md#troubleshooting)).

## 1.0

The first public release: Android TV 13 on PlayStation 4, installed from a single PKG and booted from the console's internal drive.

[1.0 release](https://github.com/odiecay/android-tv-ps4/releases/tag/v1.0)

### Highlights

- **Android TV 13** with Google Play services and the Play Store
- **One-PKG install** from the PS4 home screen. Nothing is repartitioned, and Android lives in ordinary files on the internal drive.
- **Boots without a PC or network.** The launcher hands its payload to GoldHEN on the console itself.
- **32 GiB of Android storage** that only takes up space as you use it
- **Ten apps pre-installed:** YouTube, Spotify, VLC, Jellyfin, Kodi, Plex, TV Bro, BiglyBT, Crossy Road and AIDA64 ([versions](APPS.md))
- **Bluetooth controllers and remotes:** DualShock 4 and Google TV Streamer remote tested; the PS button goes to Home
- **Wi-Fi and Ethernet**, managed by Android
- **Restart and Shut down** in Android return to the PS4 system or power the console off

### Requirements

- PS4 **CUH-1102A (Aeolia)** on firmware **13.52** with GoldHEN. Other models and firmware aren't supported yet.
- GoldHEN **BinLoader** enabled on port **9090**
- An exFAT USB drive to install the PKG
- About 8 GiB of free internal space to install. Usage grows as Android fills its storage, up to about 43 GiB if all 32 GiB is used ([Storage](STORAGE.md)).

### Install

1. Download both PKG parts and the joining tool from the release page.
2. Windows: double-click **Join-PKG-Windows.cmd**. Linux/macOS: run `sh join-pkg.sh`. Wait for **READY**.
3. Copy `Android-TV-for-PS4.pkg` to an exFAT USB drive and install it with GoldHEN's Package Installer.
4. Enable BinLoader and open **Android TV for PS4**.

The **first launch takes 5–10 minutes**. Later launches take about **2 minutes**.

### Known issues

- No HDCP, and this isn't a Google-certified device. Some DRM-protected video won't play (7plus, for example).
- YouTube needs you to sign in; guest playback can fail.
- On one Kayo 4.6.1 screen, the controller's X button does nothing. Use the Google TV remote's centre button.
- Setup may leave the base device name in place. Set it to **PlayStation 4** in Settings so Spotify Connect shows the right name.
- If BinLoader is unavailable (error 61), close the app, toggle BinLoader off and on, and reopen it.
